# WAREHOUSE DATABASE üöÄÔ∏è

A database that houses all the data that we need to create:

1. Schemes
2. Sponsors
3. Members
4. Contributions

**NOTE: **  Fundmaster should NOT be installed in this database. Use queries to extract and export data to your target database

## Extensions

The following extensions need to be installed to make queries lightweight:

1. tsm_system_rows - for quick randomization

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION tsm_system_rows;
   SELECT * FROM my_table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_ROWS(100);
   ```
2.

## Tables Warehouse database:

1. schemes_warehouse - Used to create schemes data

   ```sql
   with data as (select c.*
                 from schemes_warehouse c
                          left join schemes s on s.id = c.id
                 order by random() fetch next :rows rows only
   )
   INSERT INTO SCHEMES (ID, ACTIVE, ACT_FACT_MODE, ADMINS_MODE, ALLOW_INVEST_PROF, BEN_CALC_MODE, CONTR_NET_SS_DED,
                        DATE_CLOSED, DEFICIT_TREAT_MODE, EXCESS_ALLOC_MODE, EXCESS_CONTR_DET,

   select nextval('seq'),'YES', 'FACTOR_BASED', 'MEMBER_LEVEL', 'NO', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'RESERVE_OUTFLOW',
          'EMPLOYEE_PRIORITY', 0, NULL, 'ANNUAL_INTEREST', NULL, NULL, 1, 0, 0, NULL, 0, 'OPEN', d.industry,
          NULL, d.country, d.domain, '', '', d.locality,
          '', NULL, d.locality, d."linkedin url",d.name,'DEFINED_CONTRIBUTION',1
   from data d;
   ```
2. peoplenames - Used to create membership data

   ```sql
   create unique index id_indx on peoplenames using btree (
                                                    id nulls last
       );

   ``` 

   Export to members template:

      ```SQL
